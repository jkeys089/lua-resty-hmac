Status
======

This library is still under active development and is considered production ready.

Description
===========

This library requires an nginx build with OpenSSL,
the [ngx_lua module](http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpLuaModule), and [LuaJIT 2.0](http://luajit.org/luajit.html).

On 2017-12-07, I (Adam Cecile) added OpenSSL 1.1 support that brings Debian Stretch out of the box experience.
Sadly there's no way to determine OpenSSL through FFI C-bindings so I had to use an environment variable to trigger legacy code.

In top nginx configuration file add
```
env HMAC_USE_LEGACY_OPENSSL_API=1;
```
Otherwise it will use OpenSSL 1.1 calls.


Synopsis
========

```lua
    # nginx.conf:

    lua_package_path "/path/to/lua-resty-hmac/lib/?.lua;;";

    server {
        location = /test {
            content_by_lua_file conf/test.lua;
        }
    }

    -- conf/test.lua:

    local hmac = require "resty.hmac"

    local hmac_sha1 = hmac:new("secret_key", hmac.ALGOS.SHA1)
    if not hmac_sha1 then
        ngx.say("failed to create the hmac_sha1 object")
        return
    end

    local ok = hmac_sha1:update("he")
    if not ok then
        ngx.say("failed to add data")
        return
    end

    ok = hmac_sha1:update("llo")
    if not ok then
        ngx.say("failed to add data")
        return
    end

    local mac = hmac_sha1:final()  -- binary mac

    local str = require "resty.string"
    ngx.say("hmac_sha1: ", str.to_hex(mac))
        -- output: "hmac_sha1: aee4b890b574ea8fa4f6a66aed96c3e590e5925a"

    -- dont forget to reset after final!
    if not hmac_sha1:reset() then
        ngx.say("failed to reset hmac_sha1")
        return
    end

    -- short version
    ngx.say("hmac_sha1: ", hmac_sha1:final("world", true))
        -- output: "hmac_sha1: 4e9538f1efbe565c522acfb72fce6092ea6b15e0"
```

Methods
=======

To load this library,

1. you need to specify this library's path in ngx_lua's [lua_package_path](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_package_path) directive. For example, `lua_package_path "/path/to/lua-resty-hmac/lib/?.lua;;";`.
2. you use `require` to load the library into a local Lua variable:

```lua
    local hmac = require "resty.hmac"
```

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

new
---
`syntax: local hmac_sha256 = hmac:new(key [, hash_algorithm])`

Creates a new hmac instance. If failed, returns `nil`.

The `key` argument specifies the key to use when calculating the message authentication code (MAC).
`key` is a lua string which may contain printable characters or binary data.

The `hash_algorithm` argument specifies which hashing algorithm to use (`hash.ALGOS.MD5`, `hash.ALGOS.SHA1`, `hash.ALGOS.SHA256`, `hash.ALGOS.SHA512`).
The default value is `hash.ALGOS.MD5`.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

update
---
`syntax: hmac_sha256:update(data)`

Updates the MAC calculation to include new data. If failed, returns `false`.

The `data` argument specifies the additional data to include in the MAC.
`data` is a lua string which may contain printable characters or binary data.

final
---
`syntax: local mac = hmac_sha256:final([data, output_hex])`

Finalizes the MAC calculation and returns the final MAC value. If failed, returns `nil`.
When `output_hex` is not `true` returns a lua string containing the raw, binary MAC. When `output_hex` is `true` returns a lua string containing the hexadecimal representation of the MAC.

The `data` argument specifies the additional data to include in the MAC before finalizing the calculation.
The default value is `nil`.

The `output_hex` argument specifies wether the MAC should be returned as hex or binary. If `true` the MAC will be returned as hex.
The default value is `false`.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

reset
------
`syntax: hmac_sha256:reset()`

Resets the internal hmac context so it can be re-used to calculate a new MAC. If failed, returns `false`.
If successful, the `key` and `hash_algorithm` remain the same but all other information is cleared.

This MUST be called after `hmac_sha256:final()` in order to calculate a new MAC using the same hmac instance.

Prerequisites
=============

* [LuaJIT](http://luajit.org) 2.0+
* [ngx_lua module](http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpLuaModule)
* [lua-resty-string](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-string) 0.8+
* [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) 1.0.0+

Installation
============

It is recommended to use the latest [ngx_openresty bundle](http://openresty.org) directly. You'll need to enable LuaJIT when building your ngx_openresty
bundle by passing the `--with-luajit` option to its `./configure` script.

Also, You need to configure
the [lua_package_path](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_package_path) directive to
add the path of your lua-resty-hmac source tree to ngx_lua's Lua module search path, as in

```nginx
    # nginx.conf
    http {
        lua_package_path "/path/to/lua-resty-hmac/lib/?.lua;;";
        ...
    }
```

and then load the library in Lua:

```lua
    local hmac = require "resty.hmac"
```
